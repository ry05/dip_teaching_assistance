# DIPTA - Digital Image Processing Teaching Assistant

**Author** - Ramshankar Yadhunath (CSE Department, Amrita School of Engineering, Bengaluru) <br>
**Guided By** - Mrs. Jyotsana C (CSE Department, Amrita School of Engineering, Bengaluru)

## The Purpose of DIPTA
DIPTA was originally conceived for the following purposes :
-  Aid teachers to explain DIP concepts with relative ease using real simulations
-  Aid students to have a quick recap of DIP concepts before test day
-  Begin an open source initiative to improve the coding culture at the college

## Project Structure
-  dipta.py : Python file containing the main code
-  Graphic_Content : Folder containing graphical material created for the GUI frontend (using Canva)
-  Input_Images : Folder containing images that can be used as input for DIPTA

## DIPTA User Instructions
-  Download / Clone this repository to your local system
-  Extract the repo
-  Navigate to the repo from command line
-  Run the following command to install the dependencies required
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
-  Run dipta.py using any python compatible editor. For this, run the following command
```
python dipta.py
```
-  DIPTA should open as a desktop application then

## Areas of Future Scope
At present, the project has a lot of areas of improvement. A few that I can identify are
-  More image processing techniques can be incorporated
-  Insufficient documentation for the project
-  The project has to be packaged as standalone software in the future

## Making Contributions
Contributions in any of the following sectors (not an exhaustive list) are highly encouraged :
-  Programming
-  Designing the User Interface
-  Improving Documentation
-  Creating "How-to-guides"
