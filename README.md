# DIPTA - Digital Image Processing Teaching Assistant
Teaching Assistance Application for Digital Image Processing Techniques

**Original Author** - Ramshankar Yadhunath (@ry05)
**Guide** - Mrs. Jyotsana C (CSE Department, Amrita School of Engineering, Bengaluru)

**Purpose of project** - Initially intended as a **submission for a 10 mark mini-project** during my 5th semester as a part of the **Digital Image Processing(DIP)** elective.

### The Aim
* Designing a GUI Interface for learning DIP
* To provide software support to DIP teachers

### Areas of Future Scope
At present, the project has a lot of areas of improvement. A few that I can identify are
* Lack of structure in the file system involved
* Insufficient documentation for the project
* More image processing techniques can be incorporated

Would love it if there are **volunteers** interested in contributing towards this idea.
